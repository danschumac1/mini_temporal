`config.hidden_act` is ignored, you should use `config.hidden_activation` instead.
Gemma's activation function will be set to `gelu_pytorch_tanh`. Please, use
`config.hidden_activation` if you want to override this behaviour.
See https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/29402 for more details.

This might lead to some unexpected behaviour due to overflow issues when training a model in half-precision. You might consider adding `tokenizer.padding_side = 'right'` to your code.
